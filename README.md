# How to Detect Concrete Lining in GPR Images Using Mask R-CNN

- This model does not provide training and validation sets in accordance with our data sharing policy.
- The training file of this paper, model_final.pth, is provided in hugging face, so you can download it and check the detection results.
- my_dataset_test can be applied by downloading the test.zip stored on GitHub and specifying the path of your choice

# How to Detect Concrete Lining in GPR Images Using YOLOv8

- This model does not provide training and validation sets in accordance with our data sharing policy.
- Go into the yaml file and change the path of the test set to yours
- For YOLOv8, the training files have been uploaded to the GitHub repository, so if you download the test dataset and the yaml file YOLO_best.pt and set a new path, you can see the resulting images.
